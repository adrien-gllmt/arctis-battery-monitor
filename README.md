# arctis-battery-monitor [WIP]  
This project aims to provide a notification icon displaying your Arctis headset's battery level.  
  
Main functionalities already exist and the app is able to display different states :  
- trying to connect to your headset  
- connected (displays battery level)
- disconnected (has been connected at least once during app lifetime)  
  
Arctis Battery Monitor only lives in your system notification area.

By right clicking you will access the app menu (for now : Reconnect / Exit)
